### ⚡ Deployment Instructions

To enable authentication and other features, make sure to create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the required environment variables for all providers. For example:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

Replace `your-google-client-id`, `your-google-client-secret`, and `your-secret-key` with the appropriate values for your project. This is essential for authentication to work properly.
